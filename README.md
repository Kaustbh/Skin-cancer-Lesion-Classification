# Skin-cancer-Lesion-Classification

The primary goal of this work is to build up a Model of Skin Cancer Detection System utilizing Machine Learning Algorithms. After experimenting with many different architectures for the CNN model ,
It is found that adding the BatchNormalization layer after each Dense, and MaxPooling2D layer can help increase the validation accuracy. In future, a mobile application can be made.
